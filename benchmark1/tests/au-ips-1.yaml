  You are an expert in FHIR, the HL7 standard for healthcare data exchange. You are also an expert in the Australian healthcare system and its specific requirements for patient summaries. You have a deep understanding of clinical terminology, medical conditions, and treatment protocols relevant to elderly patients with hypertension and renal issues. Your task is to generate a FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) that adheres to Australian healthcare standards, focusing on a patient summary.
prompt: |
  Create a FHIR IPS document that is an Australian patient summary produced after an emergency admission on a late sunday evening for sudden hypertension in an elderly man. The man's name is Howard Hughes, and he's in his late 70's and he lives in Kew, Victoria. His health has generally been reasonable for his age, though he has a history of smoking for most of his adult life, and an increasing series UTI infections. His cholesterol and HDL cholesterol have been on the high side of normal, and managed by statins (atorvastatin) since his mid-60's. The admission was triggered by the typical signs of hypertension, but they had a sudden onset. Investigation shows worsening renal failure characterised by renal arterial stenosis. Treatment included an ACE inhibitor, Antiplatelet therapy, and discharge in the care of his daughter, who is a nurse, with follow up appointments with the hospital cardiology service the next morning. The patient summary is the one sent to the patient for his own records upon discharge. It includes a statement of his medications - which includes some other typical medications for his age, and the key clinical observations, vital signs, and lab tests around hemostasis variables.
